# pi-outlets
A few python scripts that allow you to first sniff out a wireless RF signal then send that signal out to control wireless power outlets.  The scripts are an adaptation of scripts provided by <a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/george7378/">George7378</a> who wrote a great tutorial on Instructables <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-Raspberry-Pi-433MHz-Home-Automation">Super simple Raspberry Pi 433MHz home automation</a>

The project itself takes my own spin on what he has done in his tutorial.  

I have also included a pdf and power point of the presentation given at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FW-Dev/events/234322151/">Fort Wayne Open Source Developers meetup</a> on 10-13-2016
